/* Usage:
 * Step 1: Create a global variable to hold the logger object.
 * neekiLog nl;
 *
 * Step 2: Create a new logger object inside setup(). It MUST be in setup or
 *         else weird stuff happens, like the log file winding up in the
 *         Processing directory, and that gives you bad permissions errors.
 *
 *         If you don't want to log to a file, simply change sketchPath() to
 *         a boolean false value. The logger is smart enough to do the rest.
 *
 * void setup() {
 *   nl = new neekiLog(neekiLog.INFO,true,sketchPath(""));
 * }
 *
 * Step 3: Print debug messages where ever you want them.
 *
 * void draw() {
 *   nl.INFO("This is an INFO log message");
 *   nl.DEBUG("This is a DEBUG log message");
 * }
 *
 * Step 4: Have fun with it :D
